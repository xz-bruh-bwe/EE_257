1. Make sure that all of the necesary libraries are downloaded before the code runs.

2. Make sure the datasets is in the same directory folder as the .ipynb submitted with this README file

3. There is a section where the correlation output is written to a csv file. That section is commented out make the code run easier. If it is desired to run that section, necessary parameters would need to be changed like the directory setting. Best to leave that uncommented.

4. Finally, within the jupyter terminally, individually run each cell. 

Warning: Run each cell individually because some of the code is computationally intensive and will take a long while.
